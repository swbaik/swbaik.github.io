    <h1><u>About Me</u></h1>
      <img src="IMG_0146.JPG">
      <p>I am currently a journalist + creative based around New York, aspiring to tell the stories of places and people rarely heard.</p>
      <p>These stories come alive to me through audio &amp; visuals. I seek to understand the perspectives that define an individual's human experience.</p>
      <p>When I'm not working, I like to play music, watch movies and take pictures.</p>
