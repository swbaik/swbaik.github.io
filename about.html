    <h1>About Me</h1>
      <img src="IMG_0146.JPG">
      <p>I am a journalist + creative, aspiring to tell stories of places or people rarely heard.</p>
      <p>For me, these stories come alive through audio &amp; dialogue. I seek to understand the amalgam of perspectives and worldviews that define an individual's human experience.</p>
      <p>I commute between North NJ, where I live, and New York City, where I explore.</p>
