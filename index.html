  Students Celebrate Love In Washington Square Park In Response to Election</a>
  <p>Students from NYU, The New School and other universities around New York City gathered in the rain at Washington Square Park after the 2016 Presidential election. I reported the scene, taking pictures and interviewing participants or onlookers, for the New School Free Press.</p>

  <p>After hearing a student's complaint that not many attend concerts at Mannes, I reported a story on audience turnout for orchestral concerts at the university. To my surprise, I found out that actually the turnout as increased and that the orchestra actually do gather a quite sizeable audience for their concerts. Photo by Julia Himmel.</p>

  Let's Talk About This Election, Shall We?</a>
  <p>This was a class assignment that set a challenge to speak with strangers on the streets, to find contacts through Twitter, and to follow up with a topic. I spent some hours at Washington Square Park before and after the presidential election and documented people's voices. Though Twitter and some phone calls, I also speak with Clinton Canvassers from out-of-state, including Florida and Michigan.</p>

      Passing Through The Bugaboos</a>
  <p>In practicing my visual reporting, I try my hand at annotating a photo. I interviewed my father, an avid rock-climber, who had recently returned from his two-week trip to British Columbia to climb Snowpatch Spire.</p>

  <p>With Sydney Oberfeld and Molly Mintz, I explored 'nostalgia' as it exists at Katz's Delicatessen, an iconic restaurant located in New York City's lower east side. I contributed two articles that discuss the history of Katz's and the strange surge of youth that flood Katz's tables in contrast to its old interior. Photo by Sydney Oberfeld.</p>
