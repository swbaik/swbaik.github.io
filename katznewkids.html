  <h1>The New Kids On The Block</h1>
  <h2>Katz's Deli invites another crowd to add to its extensive history</h2>
  <p><i>by Seung Won Baik</i></p>

        <p>Okay, you walk through the glass-windowed doors, grab an orange ticket and glance at the neon signs, the wall of meat, the slicers shouting from behind the counter. You may laugh, nudge your elbow at a friend, as you recognize the celebrities in the photos framed and hung across the length of one wall in the deli. As you stand there on line and wait to order, you begin to realize that Katz’s Deli is a place of history, an encapsulation of some New York-nostalgia, of what the neighborhood once was and is becoming in the Lower East Side. So, you get why you see Jewish families visiting from out of town to grab a bite to eat. You understand why there is the older married couple in Sunday’s best chowing down together on a pastrami sandwich.
            <br><br>But, in the midst of these people, you see another crowd, who often cannot speak more than a few phrases of English, that fill Katz’s aisles and make incredulous gaping faces as they hold up their pastrami sandwich for a picture on their Instagram. They sit alongside the older married couple while they send a quick snap of their food to their friends to provoke well-earned jealousy. They munch on their pastrami with one hand and scroll through their social feeds with the other. What are these kids doing here? Don’t we know the great depth of history that we’re stepping into when we go for a sandwich at Katz’s? Apparently, we do.</p>

        <p class="PullQuote" onmouseover="style.color='#f24b13'" onmouseout="style.color='black'">“Yeah, it’s no longer just the old Jewish guy sitting in the back, smoking cigarettes, eating corned beef, sipping on Cel-Ray tonic. That person, well for starters, is probably dead. But, that’s not our only customer anymore, which is a good thing,” said Jake Dell, the 28 year old owner of Katz’s. </p>

        <p>Jake explains that now Katz’s Deli attracts customers from all over New York, all over the world even. Alongside the New York natives are foreigners, tourists, who are craving to experience the food at Katz’s and are eager to boast about their sandwiches to friends back home. Many pull out their phones, already sending a quick snap to their Snap Story or choosing a filter for their Instagram post.</p>

        <p>Most first timers arrive at Katz’s having heard the stories, the delicious food, the lively crowd. Others, like Samuel and his companion, begin their first encounter with a quick search on Yelp.</p>
        <p>“We flew all the way to New York to get this awesome delicious pastrami because Yelp told us to. We went on Trip Advisor, we googled, we looked around. We want the best food in New York, right? So what do we do? We go and do our research!” preached the 20 year-old Los Angeles native while pointing at his smartphone with one hand and holding a half of Katz’s pastrami sandwich in the other.</p>
        <p>The two share a laugh, sharing that they would definitely come back to visit, and return to consuming the pastrami laden with mustard in front of them.</p>
        <p>The thing that most of these first time diners seem to initially notice and comment on is the sheer number of people, especially as they’re struggling to navigate along the counter and to order. A young married couple from Munich, Nadine and David, describe their time at Katz’s. Nadine recounts being amazed by the amount of people crammed into the deli and the meats that lined the counter’s walls. David has been to Katz’s once before on a trip to New York City.</p>
        <p class="PullQuote" onmouseover="style.color='#f24b13'" onmouseout="style.color='black'">“I knew what I was getting myself into,” says David with a laugh, “I had high expectations coming back for the second but it’s still amazing.”</p>
        <p>He remembers three years ago asking his three other coworkers what he must do during the sole 20 hours he had on his business trip to New York. That was his first visit to Katz’s. Now, after appealing to his wife with pictures from Instagram, David has returned with Nadine to try the pastrami sandwich at Katz’s.</p>
        <p>When asked whether the couple will be back at Katz’s, they both responded with a confident <b onmouseover="">“definitely.”</b></p>

        <p>Andrés, who is 24 and from Madrid, is visiting Katz’s for his first time but is already ordering for his second pastrami sandwich with mustard. He’s sharing this second sandwich with his friend, Marcus, who is 27 and from Munich. Marcus had previously visited Katz’s only ten days ago and already he is back with Andrés to show him what he found.</p>

        <p class="PullQuote" onmouseover="style.color='#f24b13'" onmouseout="style.color='black'">“I think the good thing here is that you can be like you are. You don’t have to dress up like with a fancy restaurant. You come here and you can be the way you are. Just having a good time,” said Marcus.</p>

        <p>“When you come especially to New York, you want to do all the typically American things. When you get inside, you see that it’s not only for tourists. You know like when you go to Times Square, it’s full of tourists. You come here and see that there are also people from New York that come and have lunch here,” Andrés explained, “I think young tourists like me, we don’t like doing things that you see that everything is a little bit fake because it’s planted for tourists. When you get here you don’t get that feeling. I think that’s a good thing, a good reason to come back. It’s a real American place where people come.”</p>
        <p>For Carrie, she feels like she’s coming home whenever she comes back to Katz’s. She confides that she grew up in a Jewish family; that, food is an essential part of her culture. She recognizes that there are a lot of Jewish roots in New York City and Katz’s Deli brings that alive to her.</p>

        <p class="PullQuote" onmouseover="style.color='#f24b13'" onmouseout="style.color='black'">“Feeling like you belong to a certain restaurant is a rare feeling. And I feel very comfortable in this environment and I feel connected to it different way than I do other places,” — Carrie, 21, Toronto</p>

        <p>And, they’re right.There is a certain atmosphere at Katz that slowly reveals a side of us that we all share, the kind where we all want stay with what’s good, with what we love. It’s a quality felt by all customers, local and abroad, regulars and first timers.</p>
        <p>“If you like one thing, why would you want to change it? It’s good enough,” said Andres.</p>
        <p>So, despite the constant re-sculpting of New York City’s neighborhoods, the increase in boutique stores and residential condos, the spirit of what once was, and still is New York, is here at Katz. It’s preserved, contained and celebrated within the corner deli’s walls, drawing crowds from all around who just want to taste a little bit of that feeling, especially in a world that is rapidly changing. It’s felt in the consistency of excellence that is tasted with every return and every bite into Katz’s sandwiches. It’s the reason why young people, who may or may not have a foot in Katz’s door of history and culture, might feel welcome to return, return and return again, adding to the long narrative of what Katz’s was, is, and will become in the decades to come.</p>
        <p>As Jake Dell, owner of Katz Deli, puts it, “My tourists come back every time they come to New York. They make sure they come back here, and in that way they are regulars. So even though they’re not from New York, they are regulars — and sitting right next to them is a New Yorker…They’re all sitting at the same table because at the end of the day, the food they’re eating is universal and this place is universal.”</p>
        <p>Jake Dell shares his plan to open an outpost in Brooklyn in an attempt to expand and bring a little bit of the nostalgia to people who find it hard to come all the way to Katz.</p>
        <p class="PullQuote" onmouseover="style.color='#f24b13'" onmouseout="style.color='black'">“My regulars in Brooklyn can’t come get this because the lines get too long and crazy, so I’m opening up a little outpost in Brooklyn in the fall. It’s not a full restaurant; it’s just take-out only, for sandwiches, because you can bring food closer to people and make it easier for people to eat. It’s harder to re-do nostalgia.”</p>
        <p>Katz’s is a testament to a spirit that has endured through the decades. Sure, the nostalgia at Katz’s speaks to a period of time that many of the current customers cannot recall. Yet, it is still recognized, even recreated, in the sharing of sandwiches, the presentation of photographs, and the returning of first-timers to the deli. It is a part of an ongoing narrative that hasn’t ended but is continuing, reshaping, through the crowds that eagerly enter through the door. Perhaps, you’ll find yourself in front of the counter one day, making memories to remembered for another time in your future.</p>
